It is a simple application to learn Spanish words. It will display a popular spanish word along with pronunciation and the frequency after 4 seconds it will display the english meaning along with pronunciation.
If you alredy know the meaning just press **_Tick_** mark and that word will not be shown again. If You don't know about the meaning of the word press **_Cross_** mark and that word will be shown again.
For datasets If you want to use simple csv or any other database you can use it. I used MySQL to store and save progress. I have used Tkinter to build the UI. You can use any thing else.
